# PG-FD: Mapping Functional Dependencies to the Future Property Graph Schema Standard

PG-FD is a Python program that uses the *networkx* Python module of https://networkx.org/ and the *functional_dependencies* of https://oer.gitlab.io/cs/functional-dependencies.

Usage :

## Replaying the article examples
To replay the examples of the article, user can execute function `GPFigureX()`, with 'X' corresponding to the number of the figure in the article. User should, for example, execute `GPFigure4()` to translate the Graph dependency of Figure 4 in the article.

The function returns a string corresponding to the PG-Schema translation.
